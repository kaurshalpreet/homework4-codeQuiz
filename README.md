# Web APIs: Code Quiz

## Description
 This project is a timed code quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by a JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes. I have learnt a lot in creating this game. This was something very new for me and I have put so much effort in learning, understanding and executing the concepts of javascript and web API.
